## üöÄ Project Overview

**SkillChain DApp** is a robust decentralized platform designed to revolutionize how digital credentials are issued, managed, and verified using cutting-edge blockchain technology. Developed as a full-stack application, it features a dynamic React (Vite.js) frontend and a powerful Node.js/Express backend, all interacting with Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Base Sepolia network.

The core objective is to empower individuals with true, immutable ownership of their academic, professional, and personal achievements, while providing institutions with a secure, transparent, and efficient system for credentialing.

## ‚ú® Features

SkillChain DApp supports three distinct user roles, each with tailored functionalities:

### 1. Administrator (Admin)
*   **Role:** Manages the entire SkillChain ecosystem.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Issuer Registration & Verification:** Onboard new educational institutions or companies as authorized credential issuers, assigning them verification levels.
    *   **Issuer Management:** Update issuer details, adjust reputation scores, and manage their operational status (deactivate, reactivate, or remove).
    *   **Admin Role Transfer:** Securely transfer the administrative control of the platform to a new address.
    *   **Comprehensive Oversight:** View all registered issuers and their current statuses.

### 2. Issuer (Institutions & Companies)
*   **Role:** Authorized entities responsible for issuing credentials.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Profile Management:** View their registered profile details, including verification status and reputation.
    *   **NFT Credential Minting:**
        *   **Single Mint:** Issue unique, non-transferable (soulbound) ERC-721 NFT credentials (e.g., degrees, high-value certifications) to individual recipients.
        *   **Batch Mint:** Efficiently issue multiple NFT credentials to many recipients in a single blockchain transaction.
    *   **General Credential Issuance:** Issue verifiable records (e.g., course completion certificates, participation awards) via a dedicated registry.
    *   **Credential Revocation:** Invalidate any credential they previously issued.
    *   **Credential Tracking:** View all credentials issued by their institution.

### 3. Recipient (Students & Employees)
*   **Role:** Individuals who receive and own the digital credentials.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Personalized Credential Dashboard:** A central hub to view all NFT and General credentials issued to their connected Web3 wallet.
    *   **Credential Details:** Access comprehensive information for each credential, including issuer details and associated content from IPFS.
    *   **Privacy Settings:** Granular control over what information (e.g., recipient address, issuer name, credential type) is publicly visible during verification.
    *   **Verification Tools:**
        *   **Generate Verification Proof:** Create a cryptographic proof of a credential's validity at a specific point in time.
        *   **Generate QR Code:** Instantly generate a scannable QR code that links directly to the public verification page for their credential.
    *   **Public Verification Page:** A publicly accessible portal where anyone can verify a credential using its ID, respecting the recipient's privacy preferences.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

To run SkillChain DApp locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js (v18 or higher) & npm:** [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **MetaMask browser extension:** Installed and configured for Base Sepolia.
*   **WalletConnect Project ID:** Obtain one from [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).
*   **Pinata API Key, Secret API Key, and JWT:** Obtain from [pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud/).

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agihtaws/skillchain.git
cd skillchain
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Contract Setup (Hardhat Project)
Navigate to your Hardhat project directory (this is the skillchain root folder).

A. Environment Variables (.env)
Create a .env file in your Hardhat project root with the following (replace placeholders with your actual values):
```bash
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_ADMIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
FRONTEND_RENDER_URL=https://skillchain-frontend-kcoy.onrender.com # Your deployed frontend URL
```

B. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

C. Compile Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

D. Deploy Contracts
Deploy your contracts to the Base Sepolia testnet. This will output the deployed contract addresses.
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia
```

E. Note Contract Addresses
Crucially, save these deployed contract addresses:

```
IssuerRegistry: 0x4b0989065f79128D4a537283AA05d8555F132F82
CredentialRegistry: 0x4Df9A6FE9A806CfDb87eDf49995F8636Ae2FF5Ea
CredentialNFT: 0xFc419383BdfE4d550d913d3f7c418ef05487f84e
VerificationContract: 0x3F52de984aBf402a0c01d687888bD62d0537aB3F
```

You'll need them for the backend and frontend .env files in the next steps.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup (skillchain-backend)
Open a new terminal tab/window and navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd skillchain-backend
```

A. Environment Variables (.env)
Create a .env file in skillchain-backend with the following (replace placeholders and contract addresses from your deployment):
```bash
PORT=3000
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
ISSUER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x4b0989065f79128D4a537283AA05d8555F132F82

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Local frontend URL for CORS during development
```

B. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install # or yarn install
```

C. Run Backend
```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:3000. You can test a GET endpoint like http://localhost:3000/admin/total-issuers in your browser.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup (skillchain-frontend)
Open another new terminal tab/window and navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd skillchain-frontend
```

A. Environment Variables (.env)
Create a .env file in skillchain-frontend with the following (replace placeholders and contract addresses):
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Your local backend URL for development
VITE_ISSUER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x4b0989065f79128D4a537283AA05d8555F132F82
